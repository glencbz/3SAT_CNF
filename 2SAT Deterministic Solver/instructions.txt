How to use our 2-SAT Solver

Our 2-SAT Solver uses four different classes in Java, 

CNFsolver.java
CNFparser.java
CNFSatInstance.java
SCCGraph.java

To use our class, open up CNFSolver.java, you should see:

public class CNFsolver {
	public static void main(String[] args){

		//Replace src/testcase.cnf with the cnf file that you want to solve
		CnfSatInstance CNF = CNFparser.parseCnfFile("src/filename.cnf");
		long started = System.nanoTime();
		CNF.initialise();
		CNF.solve();
		long timeTaken = System.nanoTime() - started;
		System.out.println("Time Taken: "+timeTaken/1000000.0 + "ms");

	}
}

To use the 2-SAT Solver
1) Place the cnf file you want to calculate in the src folder of your eclipse project with the classes provided
2) By replacing the argument within CNFparser.parseCnfFile() in the second line of the main function with the path of the cnf file you want to use in this format. "src/filename.cnf"
